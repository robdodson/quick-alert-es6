# quick-alert

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

## Playing With The Element

[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve). This will make serving bower assets easier. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can preview the element at
